## ROS 2 Eloquent Windows 10 install tips

Follow this guide, but read the notes below first.
<https://docs.ros.org/en/eloquent/Installation/Windows-Install-Binary.html>

You DO need to install VS Code, even if you have it already, since we need to add specific build components that you probably didnâ€™t opt-in to installing last time.

Even if you already have a newer version of python, you do need to install python 3.8 or whatever version is listed in the first line of C:\dev\ros2-windows\Scripts\ros2-script.py. Any other version will result in ros2 failing to launch.

You need to run C:\dev\ros2-windows\local_setup.bat every time you start a new command prompt. Make a batch script for it.
