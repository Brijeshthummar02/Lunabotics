### ROS2 Humble Windows 10 install tips

Follow this guide, but read the notes below first.

You DO need to install VS Code, even if you have it already, since we need to add specific build components that you probably didnâ€™t opt-in to installing last time.

Even if you already have a newer version of python, you do need to install python 3.8 or whatever version is listed in the first line of C:\dev\ros2-windows\Scripts\ros2-script.py. Any other version will result in ros2 failing to launch.

You need to run C:\dev\ros2-windows\local_setup.bat every time you start a new command prompt. Make a batch script for it.
